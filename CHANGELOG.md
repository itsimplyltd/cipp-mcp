## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **OAuth tokens are requested for `api://<clientId>/.default`.** The previous default, `<clientId>/.default`, made Entra set `aud` to the bare client id. CIPP App Service authentication that only allows `api://<clientId>` then rejected every call with HTTP 401 and an empty body. An explicit `CIPP_TOKEN_SCOPE` (or `x-token-scope`) still wins. When no explicit scope is set, a CIPP 401 is retried once with the other automatic audience (the legacy bare-GUID scope, or `api://` when that legacy scope was the one pinned) and the audience that succeeds is reused for that client. A later 401 drops the pin and tries the other audience once, so a CIPP that changes which audience it allows is not stuck until restart. The retry is skipped for any other status, never happens more than once per request, and can be turned off with `CIPP_TOKEN_SCOPE_FALLBACK=false` (`TOKEN_SCOPE_FALLBACK`, or the `x-token-scope-fallback` header). `listTenants` now calls `ListTenants` with GET and sends `AllTenantSelector` as a query parameter, which is what `Invoke-ListTenants` reads.

### Added
- **`cipp_list_trusted_blocked_senders` — a mailbox's safe-sender and blocked-sender lists** (Aaron directive 2026-10-02). Wraps CIPP's `ListUserTrustedBlockedSenders`, which calls `Get-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration -Identity <upn>`, and returns each configured trusted/blocked sender or domain as its own row (`UserPrincipalName`, `Type`, `TypeProperty`, `Value`). An empty list means the mailbox has none configured — normal, not an error. Read-only (`Exchange.Mailbox.Read` upstream); no write/remove tool was added, since the request was only to view the lists.
  - Shaped against `Invoke-ListUserTrustedBlockedSenders.ps1` (CyberDrain/CIPP, `dev` branch): the endpoint takes `UserId` and `userPrincipalName` as separate query params, but only `UserId` drives which mailbox is read (it is both the EXO request anchor and the `Get-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration -Identity` value) — `userPrincipalName` is purely a label echoed into each returned row. Confirmed against the companion write entrypoint (`Remove-CIPPTrustedBlockedSender.ps1`, which anchors and identifies by `UserPrincipalName` alone) that a UPN is a valid identity for this call, so both params are sent as the same UPN rather than requiring a separate Entra object-id resolution step.
  - 4 new tests in `tests/cipp.service.trusted-blocked-senders.test.ts`.
- **`cipp_list_user_signin_logs` — per-user Entra ID sign-in logs.** Wraps CIPP's `ListUserSigninLogs` and flattens each Graph `signIn` into a row a technician can read: time, app and resource, IP, location, `success`/`failure` with `errorCode` and `failureReason`, client app, Conditional Access status and the policies that actually evaluated (not-applied noise dropped), authentication requirement (whether MFA was required), an `authentication` block with the methods and steps Graph recorded (first factor included, so its presence does not imply MFA), device, and risk only when flagged. A summary counts successes and failures, distinct IPs and countries, and gives the newest/oldest timestamps.
  - Shaped against `Invoke-ListUserSigninLogs.ps1`: it reads only `tenantFilter`, `UserID` and `top` (default 50), and interpolates `UserID` unescaped into Graph's `$filter=(userId eq '<UserID>')`. Graph's `userId` is the Entra object id, so a UPN would match nothing and come back as an empty *successful* page — indistinguishable from "never signs in". The tool therefore always resolves the user through `ListUsers` first (UPN to id, or id checked to exist) and sends only the resolved GUID; an unresolvable user is an error.
  - `top` is validated to 1–1000 (one Graph page; upstream sets `-noPagination`). A page that fills `top` carries a warning that older sign-ins may exist; an empty page carries one explaining the 30-day retention and that only interactive sign-ins are returned.
  - `allTenants` is rejected client-side — upstream has no all-tenants branch — and the error points at CIPP's tenant-wide Sign-Ins report (`ListSignIns`).
  - Failures: upstream answers HTTP 500 with `["Failed to retrieve Sign In report for user <id> : Error: <reason>"]`, which is surfaced verbatim; a non-premium tenant's refusal is translated into the Entra ID P1/P2 requirement. A string arriving in a 200 body is treated as failure text rather than as "no sign-ins", and the `[null]` that PowerShell's `@($null)` produces for an empty Graph page is read as empty.
  - 21 new tests in `tests/cipp.service.signin-logs.test.ts`.

### Fixed
- **`cipp_create_user` now splits `userPrincipalName` into CIPP's `username` + `Domain` fields.** CIPP's `Invoke-AddUser` BUILDS the account's UPN by concatenation — `New-CippUser.ps1`: `$UserPrincipalName = "$($UserObj.username)@$($UserObj.Domain ? $UserObj.Domain : $UserObj.PrimDomain.value)"` — and never reads a `userPrincipalName` field, the same contract `editUser` already handles via `resolveUserIdentity`. `createUser` forwarded the full UPN untouched, so both halves were absent and the UPN upstream became `@`, failing every call with HTTP 500 `"The domain portion of the userPrincipalName property is invalid. You must use one of the verified domain names in your organization."` That message points at the tenant's verified domains, so it misdirects debugging to Entra domains, DNS and GDAP when the fault is the request body. The split uses `lastIndexOf('@')` (matching `resolveUserIdentity`) and now rejects a UPN with a missing local part or domain as `InvalidParams` instead of sending a malformed value upstream. Callers keep the single natural `userPrincipalName` argument — no schema change.

### Security
- **Enforce conduit gateway service-to-service verification on every `/mcp` request** (gateway#377 parity). The gateway signs an `X-Gateway-S2S` header on each proxied request; this container now verifies it, closing a confused-deputy gap where a compromised sibling sidecar in the shared ACA environment could otherwise impersonate the gateway to this container. Verification (`src/s2s-verify.ts`, `verifyS2sHeader`) is a near-verbatim port of conduit's own `verifyS2sHeader` (`src/proxy/s2s.ts`) and is checked in `startHttpTransport()` at the very top of the `/mcp` handler — before the POST-method check and before any OAuth-triple/static-key credential extraction. Controlled by `CONDUIT_S2S_SECRET`: empty (default) disables enforcement, matching pre-provisioning behavior exactly; non-empty rejects any request without a valid, freshly-signed header with `401`. `/health` is unauthenticated as before.

### Added
- **Mailbox and online-archive size reporting** ([#91](https://github.com/WYRE-AI/cipp-mcp/issues/91), community request). Two new tools answer the storage questions the server previously could not: who is near quota, which mailboxes need archiving, and how much Exchange storage a tenant actually consumes.
  - **`cipp_list_mailbox_usage`** reports every mailbox in a tenant — primary size, item count, quota and percent-of-quota, plus the same figures for the online archive — sorted largest first (`mailboxSize`, `archiveSize`, `totalSize` or `percentOfQuota`), with an optional `minSizeGB` floor. Tenant-wide totals are computed across every mailbox before `limit` is applied, so the summary stays true even when only the top rows come back; the default limit of 50 keeps a large tenant from blowing the client's tool-result limit, the failure [#73](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/73) hit on `cipp_list_users`.
  - **`cipp_get_mailbox_usage`** reports the same figures for one mailbox, read live.
  - Sizes are normalised to raw bytes with a human-readable rendering beside them. CIPP reports sizes in three different vocabularies — int64 byte counts from the reporting database, gigabyte floats from `ListUserMailboxDetails`, and Exchange display strings such as `"1.234 GB (1,325,400,000 bytes)"` inside the raw `Get-Mailbox` object — and all three now land on the same number rather than being handed to the caller to parse.
  - **Tenant-wide sizes require CIPP's reporting database to have been synced.** `Invoke-ListMailboxes`' live Exchange query selects no size fields whatsoever, so the cache (`UseReportDB=true`) is the only tenant-wide source. An unsynced cache surfaces upstream as an HTTP 500 whose body is a bare sentence; the tool now translates that into a named remedy instead of an opaque server error.
  - **A tenant that conceals report names is reported as a warning, not as an empty tenant.** With *Reports: conceal user, group, and site names* enabled in Microsoft 365, Graph's usage report returns 32-character hashes in place of UPNs, so `Set-CIPPDBCacheMailboxes`' join against the mailbox list matches nothing and every mailbox keeps its cached `0`. Left alone this reads as a tenant using no storage at all. Both signatures — an all-zero result set, and hash-shaped UPNs — are detected and returned alongside the totals, pointing at `cipp_get_mailbox_usage`, which reads the Exchange admin API directly and is immune.
  - Quotas on the per-user path are recovered exactly from the raw `Get-Mailbox` string rather than from the top-level field, which upstream returns with its unit stripped (`[float]($Quota -split ' ')[0]`) — a quota Exchange prints in TB would otherwise read as a handful of GB.
  - An archive that does not exist reports `enabled: false` with no size at all, rather than a measured `0` that would read as "archive present but empty".
  - `cipp_get_mailbox_usage` rejects `allTenants` rather than accepting it. `Invoke-ListUserMailboxDetails` has no all-tenants branch, so the call would first fan a `ListUsers` lookup across every managed tenant and then ask for one mailbox against a `tenantFilter` upstream cannot resolve — slow, and wrong in a way that reads like a CIPP fault. `cipp_list_mailbox_usage` does support `AllTenants`, and the error says so.
  - 64 new tests across `tests/bytes.test.ts` and `tests/cipp.service.mailbox-usage.test.ts`. Endpoint names, query-parameter casing, response field names and units were each verified against the current `CIPP-API` source; note that `ListMailboxStatistics`, the name this feature is most often assumed to use, does not exist in CIPP.
- **Scheduled out-of-office on `cipp_set_out_of_office`** (follow-up from [#75](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/75)). CIPP supports a `Scheduled` auto-reply state with a start/end window and calendar handling, which the tool's boolean `enabled` could not express — genuinely useful during offboarding. New optional parameters: `startTime`, `endTime` (ISO 8601 or Unix epoch seconds; converted to epoch, which is the form `Invoke-ExecSetOoO` parses unambiguously), `timezone`, `createOOFEvent`, `oofEventSubject`, `autoDeclineFutureRequestsWhenOOF`, `declineEventsForScheduledOOF` and `declineMeetingMessage`. Omitting the window lets CIPP default it to now through seven days later.
  - **`enabled` (boolean) is replaced by `state` (`Enabled` | `Disabled` | `Scheduled`).** A call that omits `state` — including one still sending the old `enabled` — is rejected rather than defaulted, because defaulting would silently disable the auto-reply for a caller asking to turn it on. `enabled` never functioned in any released build (see the `#75` fix below), so no working behaviour is lost.
  - Scheduled-only parameters supplied alongside `Enabled` or `Disabled` are rejected instead of silently dropped; upstream reads them only inside its `Scheduled` branch. `timezone` is exempt — CIPP applies it to every state.
- **CIPP version compatibility section in the README**, covering the three behaviours that differ across CIPP builds: offboarding reports *queued* rather than *completed*, several endpoints report failure under HTTP 200, and `DisableOneDriveSharing` / `timezone` are silently ignored by older builds.

### Fixed
- **`cipp_offboard_user` sent a payload matching nothing in `ExecOffboardUser` — no offboarding action had ever run** ([#72](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/72)). `Invoke-ExecOffboardUser` reads `$Request.Body.user.value` and hands every other body property to `Invoke-CIPPOffboardingJob` as its options object. The service sent a scalar `ID` plus four invented option names (`revokePermissions`, `disableUser`, `resetPassword`, `transferMailbox`) that match nothing upstream. Because the endpoint returns 200 the instant a task is queued, a technician could offboard a departing employee, see success, and leave the account holding every license, session, and permission.
  - The body now carries `user: [{ value: <UPN> }]` — the `{ value }` shape is required by older CIPP builds and accepted by newer ones — and resolves an object id to the account's current UPN first, since the offboarding tasks anchor Exchange and MFA operations on the UPN.
  - `cipp_offboard_user` now exposes CIPP's real action names (`DisableSignIn`, `RevokeSessions`, `ResetPass`, `RemoveLicenses`, `RemoveGroups`, `RemoveMFADevices`, `RemoveMobile`, `RemoveRules`, `RemoveTeamsPhoneDID`, `removeCalendarInvites`, `removePermissions`, `removeCalendarPermissions`, `ConvertToShared`, `HideFromGAL`, `disableForwarding`, `DisableOneDriveSharing`, `ClearImmutableId`, `DeleteUser`, plus `forward`/`KeepCopy`, `OOO`, and the `AccessAutomap` / `AccessNoAutomap` / `OnedriveAccess` collections). **Breaking:** the four previous option names are gone; they never had any effect.
  - A call selecting no actions is now rejected client-side rather than queueing a job that reports success and does nothing.
  - The result reports `status: "queued"`, never `offboarded`, and says so in the message — CIPP reports success on task *creation*, not completion.
  - Version note: `DisableOneDriveSharing` requires a recent CIPP build; older ones ignore it. CIPP builds predating `Test-CIPPOffboardingRequest` do not validate this payload at all, which is why the old shape failed silently rather than with a 400.
- **`cipp_list_users` silently ignored `searchField` / `searchValue` and returned the entire tenant** ([#73](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/73)). `Invoke-ListUsers` reads only `tenantFilter`, `UserID` and `graphFilter` from the query string. The search parameters were passed through and dropped, so "find the user matching X" silently became "here is everyone" — a correctness hazard for any caller acting on the result, and large enough on real tenants to blow the client's tool-result limit. Search is now translated into a Graph `$filter`: exact match for `userPrincipalName` and `mail`, prefix match for `displayName` (the schema description now matches the behaviour). Supplying one search parameter without the other is rejected instead of quietly dumping the tenant.
- **`cipp_set_email_forwarding` never sent `forwardOption`; the tool had never worked in any mode** ([#74](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/74)). `Invoke-ExecEmailForward` switches on `forwardOption` and assigns `$StatusCode` only inside a matching branch. With none sent no branch matched, `$StatusCode` stayed `$null`, and the PowerShell worker crashed constructing the response — surfacing as an opaque HTTP 500 with a worker stack trace rather than an API error. This affected setting a forward as well as disabling one. The service now sends `userID` (not `UserPrincipalName`), `KeepCopy` as the string upstream compares against, and an explicit `forwardOption` derived from the target address: `disabled` when `forwardTo` is omitted, `internalAddress` + `ForwardInternal: { value }` when the address sits on one of the tenant's own domains, and `ExternalAddress` + `ForwardExternal` otherwise. Costs one `ListDomains` GET on the set path only; disabling skips it.
- **`cipp_set_out_of_office` sent `UserPrincipalName` / `enabled` instead of `userId` / `AutoReplyState`** ([#75](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/75)). `Invoke-ExecSetOoO` reads `userId` and `AutoReplyState`; both of the old keys resolved to `$null`, so `Set-CIPPOutOfOffice` ran with no mailbox and no state and failed with a blank username in the error — easily misread as a tenant-side problem rather than a client bug. The service now sends `userId` and `AutoReplyState: "Enabled" | "Disabled"`, and only includes `InternalMessage` / `ExternalMessage` when non-empty so the state can be flipped without wiping the existing text. (`Scheduled` state with `StartTime` / `EndTime` remains a follow-up — the tool's boolean `enabled` cannot express it.)
- **`cipp_add_scheduled_item`: blank task name, ISO timestamps threw, and CIPP error strings were returned as success** ([#76](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/76)). Three defects in one method:
  - `Add-CIPPScheduledTask` stores `$task.Name`; the service sent `taskName`, so tasks were created with an empty name — breaking duplicate detection and leaving them effectively unfindable in the scheduler UI. Now sent as `Name`.
  - CIPP casts `[int64]$task.ScheduledTime`. An ISO 8601 string — which the tool schema documented — failed that cast and, because `Invoke-AddScheduledItem` has no try/catch, surfaced as an unhandled HTTP 500. `scheduledTime` still accepts ISO 8601 (or epoch seconds) and is now converted to Unix epoch seconds before it is sent.
  - `Add-CIPPScheduledTask` *returns* error strings rather than throwing for unknown, unauthorised, blocked and duplicate commands, and the entrypoint serves them with a hardcoded HTTP 200. These now surface as `status: "failed"` with the error text, mirroring the `editUser` treatment from [#67](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/67).
  - Also fixed: `Command` is now sent as `{ value }` (older CIPP stores `[string]$task.Command.value` with no bare-string fallback, so a bare string was stored as an empty command), and a new optional `parameters` object is passed through as `Parameters` — without it, every scheduled command ran with no arguments.
- **`cipp_edit_user` sent a payload shape upstream never reads — UPN handling and licenses were broken** ([#67](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/issues/67)). CIPP's `Invoke-EditUser` rebuilds the account's `userPrincipalName` on every call from the body's `username` + `Domain` fields (it never reads a `userPrincipalName` field), and reads licenses as `[{ value: skuId }]` objects plus a `removeLicenses` boolean. Our service sent neither shape: any edit risked an HTTP 500 ("The domain portion of the userPrincipalName property is invalid") or, worse, a silent account rename, and license changes were impossible.
  - `editUser` now resolves the target's current identity first (one narrow `ListUsers` lookup by `UserID` or `graphFilter`) and always sends `username` + `Domain` from the resolved UPN; it refuses to edit when the user cannot be resolved rather than risking a rename.
  - New `licenses` (reconciled SKU list, sent as `[{ value }]`) and `removeLicenses` parameters on `cipp_edit_user`; the mutually exclusive combination is rejected.
  - `EditUser` returns HTTP 200 even when the underlying operations fail (upstream reports failures as strings in `Results`); the service now parses `Results` and reports `status: "failed"` with the failure strings instead of implying success.
  - 11 new tests in `tests/cipp.service.edit-user.test.ts`. Fix approach and tests adapted from PR [#66](https://github.com/wyre-technology/cipp-mcp/pull/66) by @pdlaskbis (self-closed before review) — verified independently against upstream `Invoke-EditUser.ps1`.

### Added
- `cipp_list_enterprise_apps` tool — list enterprise applications
  (service principals) in a tenant via the CIPP `ListGraphRequest`
  passthrough against the `/servicePrincipals` Graph endpoint. Returns
  `appId`, `displayName`, `publisherName`, `appOwnerOrganizationId`,
  `signInAudience`, `tags`, and `createdDateTime`. Default filter
  excludes Microsoft-built-in apps (owner-org `f8cdef31-…`); pass
  `includeBuiltIn=true` to include them. Supports `tenantFilter='allTenants'`
  for cross-tenant fan-out — CIPP returns per-tenant errors (e.g. 403 from
  a tenant without GDAP delegated admin) as inline error rows rather than
  failing the whole call. This is the data foundation for the per-tenant
  SaaS-catalog audit (rank customer apps by tenant-frequency).
- OAuth 2.0 client-credentials auth against Entra ID. CIPP's "API Clients"
  integration page issues a client ID + secret — the server now exchanges
  those for a short-lived access token per request and caches it until expiry.
  Configure via `CIPP_TENANT_ID`, `CIPP_CLIENT_ID`, `CIPP_CLIENT_SECRET`
  (optional: `CIPP_TOKEN_SCOPE`, `CIPP_TOKEN_URL`).
- Gateway-mode headers for OAuth: `x-tenant-id`, `x-client-id`,
  `x-client-secret`, `x-token-scope`, `x-token-url`.
- Standards Template tooling: `cipp_list_standard_templates`,
  `cipp_create_standard_template`, and `cipp_delete_standard_template`
  manage CIPP Standards Templates; `cipp_get_tenant_drift` and
  `cipp_get_tenant_alignment` report per-tenant standards drift and
  alignment. This lets a standards baseline be managed as code.

### Fixed
- Unresolved MCPB/DXT config placeholders in credentials no longer break auth.
  Desktop bundles map env vars to `${user_config.X}` in `manifest.json`; when an
  optional field (e.g. the API key) is left blank the host injects the literal
  string `${user_config.cipp_api_key}` rather than an empty value. Because that
  literal is truthy, it silently overrode the OAuth client-credentials path and
  was sent as `Authorization: Bearer ${user_config.cipp_api_key}`, 401'ing every
  request. Credentials are now sanitised at ingress (`cleanCredential` /
  `sanitizeCredentials` in `src/utils/config.ts`) so empty, whitespace-only, and
  `${...}` placeholder values are treated as absent across all sources (env vars,
  gateway env promotion, and HTTP headers). Mirrors itglue-mcp #73.
- Documentation pointed `CIPP_BASE_URL` at the Static Web App / custom-domain
  UI URL (`https://cipp.yourdomain.com`). The SWA's built-in auth redirects
  bearer-token requests to its interactive login page, so every API call
  fails. All examples (README, `.env.example`, `smithery.yaml`,
  `manifest.json`, `docker-compose.yml`) now use the CIPP-API Azure Function
  App URL (`https://<function-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`) and the README
  explains the distinction.
- `cipp_list_domain_health` returned no data — it called CIPP's
  `ListDomainHealth` function with only `tenantFilter`. That function is a
  per-domain DNS helper requiring `Action` + `Domain` query parameters and
  ignores `tenantFilter`; called without them it returns HTTP 200 with an
  empty body, which crashed the client with "Unexpected end of JSON input".
  The tool now enumerates the tenant's domains via `ListDomains`, then runs
  the SPF / DMARC / DKIM checks per domain.
- The HTTP client no longer throws a JSON-parse error on an empty `2xx`
  response body; such responses are treated as "no content".
- `cipp_list_domain_health` could time out at the MCP gateway on tenants
  with several domains: each SPF / DMARC / DKIM check resolves DNS
  server-side at CIPP and the fan-out of slow lookups exceeded the
  gateway's tool-call deadline. Each per-domain DNS check now carries a
  15s abort timeout; a stuck lookup is reported as an `{ error }`
  placeholder for that record instead of hanging the whole tenant.

### Changed
- `cipp_list_domain_health` now skips the tenant's `.onmicrosoft.com`
  routing domain. That domain carries no real customer mail DNS, so its
  SPF / DMARC / DKIM checks only ever hung or failed with no actionable
  result.
- `CIPP_API_KEY` remains supported as a static Bearer token for backwards
  compatibility. When both static and OAuth credentials are provided, the
  static `apiKey` wins.
- Gateway-mode `/mcp` now accepts either `x-api-key` OR the OAuth header
  triple `(x-tenant-id + x-client-id + x-client-secret)`.
